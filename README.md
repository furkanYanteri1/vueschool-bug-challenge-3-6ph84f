# VueSchool Challenge - (3)

## Overview:

The 'Real-Time Clock' app is supposed to deliver real-time updates, presenting the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. But for some reason, the clock isn't updating properly.

## The Bug:

The issue with the app is that it fails to update the time dynamically; instead, the displayed time remains the same until the page is manually refreshed.

## The Mission:

Your mission is to levarage Vue's reactivity system to ensure the clock dynamically updates without requiring a manual page refresh.
